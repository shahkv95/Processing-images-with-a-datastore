To classify images with a convolutional neural network, each image needs to have the size specified by the network's input layer. 

Images usually require simple preprocessing before they can be classified. You can preprocess your images individually, 
but it is common to perform the same preprocessing steps on the entire data set. It is more efficient to apply these steps to 
the entire datastore.

We can perform basic preprocessing with the augmentedImageDatastore function, which takes an image datastore and an image size as an input.
The datastore can be passed to the classify function.
